Clustering evaluation metrics for author name disambiguation <br/>

(1) cluster-f: cluster-f precision/recall/f1 <br />
(2) k-metric: k-metric precision/recall/f1 <br />
(3) split-lump: splitting & lumping error precision/recall/f1 <br />
(4) pairwise-f: paired precision/recall/f1 <br />  
(5) b-cubed: b3 precision/recall/f1 <br />
(6) all: all types of clustering metric combined <br />
